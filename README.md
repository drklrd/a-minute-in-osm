# A minute in OpenStreetMap 

A simple app that shows OpenStreetMap (OSM) activity (all over the world) under one minute time. The background script downloads minutely diff every 5 minutes and count changes happening within a single minute. Sometimes, its very interesting to see so many things happening within that time :)

# Development

```
$ git clone https://github.com/drklrd/a-minute-in-osm.git
$ cd a-minute-in-osm
$ npm install
```

To build the client side code:

```
$ cd client
$ npm run build
```
